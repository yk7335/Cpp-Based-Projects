Known Problems:
There weren't any problems with my code except syntax errors which I fixed. The only thing I had trouble with is
remembering which constructor did what. I had trouble with the syntax for templated class because I hadn't really
practiced too much of it.
 
Short Description of Code:
This code contains a Template class of sentinel node Doubly linked list and has functions such as insert before, after and ect...

Testing:
I ran the main cpp and tested to see if my function worked properly. I made test cases for the functions that the test cases
that were not given to me.

How to run:
Run the makefile
