# Covid-19 Game Jam (Personal Project)
I competed in a Covid-19 themed game jam. Your team of 5 had to create a game that highlighted the importance of social distancing. The game is called "Market Dash!". To play the game download the zip folder and extract all the files and run the file with the name "MarketDash". The game is in windows platform email yk7335@tamu.edu to get a copy of the game in ios or android.

Known Bugs/Problems:
	1. When we created the game we added a collision layer which we made invisible so that the player cannot see it and could not go 	through objects but the layer invisibility has some glitch in Unreal Engine and it tends to show the layer completely. 
	2. After the Completion of the game to exit press start and cross out the tab.
